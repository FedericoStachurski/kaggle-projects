# Kaggle Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Kaggle portfolio!

This repository contains my solutions to selected Kaggle challenges. Each project includes well-documented code, clear exploratory data analysis, and a clean structure for reproducibility. The goal is to showcase applied machine learning and data science skills through real-world datasets.

## 📂 Challenges

- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](./titanic-survival/README.md)
- *(More coming soon...)*

## 🧱 Project Structure

Each challenge is organized in its own subfolder and typically includes:

- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, and model building
- `scripts/` – Modular Python scripts (optional)
- `submissions/` – CSV files submitted to Kaggle
- `README.md` – Summary of the problem, approach, and results
- `requirements.txt` – Dependencies used for the project
